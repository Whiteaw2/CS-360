Mobile Design and Architecture

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

  The intention of the app was to create a simple and effective app for the management of inventory in a warehouse.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

  It was critical to include a login screen, a list view of items in the warehouse, and an interface to adjust features of that inventory database. It was important to consider the different user personas during creation, though I eventually    made the decision to focus only on hands-on daily users at receiving and shipping docks. During the process I considered managers, finance, and compliance personas who may interact with the app in the longterm.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

  I approached coding the app in chunnks. I broke the app up into user persona and problem solving, market landscape to see what leaders in the space are doing, wireframes, functional prototype, and then refinement.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

  To ensure that the code was functional I populated the databases with mock data and then executed various user flows to ensure that things worked (which was not always the case).

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

  Considering the entire process, the area where I was able to innovate the most to overcome challenges was by considering the metrics for users. While I was not able to integrate framworks for radial donut graphs in time, I did visualize this solution as I felt it would be the most effective way for dailiy users to track their progress against their own, their team, and company quotas.
  
**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

  The ability to show layout as well as use of asynchronous calls were where I was able to show my ability to flex and adapt to new platforms. This was the first time I have developed for Android and I felt I was succesful in this area.
